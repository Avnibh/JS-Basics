Javascript 

1. JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the Web.

2. JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.

	JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
	ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.


3. JavaScript Variables
In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.

JavaScript uses the var keyword to declare variables.

An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6:

var x;

x = 6;


4. JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.

5. JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

In programming, text values are called text strings.

JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

Example
var pi = 3.14;
var person = "John Doe";
var answer = 'Yes I am!';
